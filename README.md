# Customer-Churn
## Overview
This project consist of supervised machine learning. It makes use of classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of a customer to churn in the FMCG supply chain and logistics sector.

## Business Understanding and Data Understanding
The stakeholders of this project are businesses that rely on repeat transactions, particularly in retail distribution and FMCG supply chains. Retaining customers is essential as it helps maintain loyalty, ensures steady revenue, and optimizes operations. The dataset used in this project is appropriate for churn prediction, as it contains a binary outcome (0 = Retained, 1 = Churned). It includes key features that provide insights into customer behavior, such as total transactions, purchase patterns, and service usage

## Problem Statement 
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting long-term profitability and growth. Identifying customers who are likely to churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to improve retention. Currently, there is a need to accurately predict customer churn to inform strategic interventions.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on the provided dataset. The objective is to analyze the dataset, visualize key trends and patterns related to churn, and provide actionable insights to reduce the churn rate. By splitting the data into training and testing sets, the model will be trained to classify customers as likely to churn or remain, enabling more targeted retention strategies.
## Components
The Jupyter Notebook is the main deliverable. It contains the details of the approach taken and the methodology. It contains data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data preparation for modelling and building the classification models.
## Technologies used
Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, NumpY, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
